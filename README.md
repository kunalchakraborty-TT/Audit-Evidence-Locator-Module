# Audit-Evidence-Locator-Module
Audit-Evidence-Locator automatically finds text inside PDFs, images, and scanned documents, then highlights each match with a red box. It works with OCR, supports Word/Excel files, and keeps the original file unchanged. A simple tool to speed up audits, reviews, and document checks.
